Loops:
Loops in the most basic sense are just ways to repeat lines of code without having to actually repeat said code. Much like a circle a loops goes around and then comes back to the starting point, then repeats itself again. Think of a short roller coaster with a loop-T-Loop, once out of the loops it comes back around and runs the loop again. Looping and repeating is also known as iteraing. The 4 loops used as an example were the while loop, dowhile loop, for loop, and the for each loop. They attach each loop to an object then monitor how it behaves. In this case the loop will continue to repeat as long as the content evaluates as true. This stops when it changes to false.
