If statements:
An extension of the If statement is the If-else statement. If this happens then this happens, else this will happen, etc... You can make the else statement further extended by adding another 'If'. So it would be if, else if, then else. The computer runs each line first, if it doesn't meet the requirements of the first two it finally trickles down to the last else statement. If statements are just a way to tell the computer that if something happens, then something else happens. If that doesn't happen then this will happen. And if this also doesn't happen then this will finally happen.
