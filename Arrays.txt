Arrays:
Arrays are a type of storage device. They store a collection of data of the same type together. We can declare an array in the same type of similair way that we decare an individual variable. After the type of the variable we use open and closed brackets. We must know that an array is not a type but a collection of variables of a certian type. Before we can use an array we have to know the length or I.E. how many elements will be stored in them. It'll look something like this: type[] nameOfArray = new type[number of elements]; for example. You can intialize an array at the same time as declaring it. You could do this by doing: type[] nameOfArray = {value, value, value, value, value}; for example.
